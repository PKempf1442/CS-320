Software Test, Automation
This course has changed the way I approached developing software. Software testing allows us as developers to ensure the efficiency, functionality, and security of our code. By testing as we go, we ensure a streamlined development process with minimal errors in the final iteration. In this project we tested for the functionality of our code and determined if it met the requirements set forth for us. We can ensure the needs of our users are met through properly identified requirements and the incorporation of feedback from our users.
